# information_retrieval_indexer
#  Example code in python programming language demonstrating some of the features of an inverted index.

#  In this example, we scan a directory containing the corpus of files. (In this case the documents are reports on articles

#  and authors submitted to the Journal "Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery" 

#

#  In this example we see each file being read, tokenized (each word or term is extracted) combined into a sorted

#  list of unique terms.
